    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I was confused by your ambiguity.Rightfully so, the words seemed to speak for themselves, An echo of a symphony of an outdated language, one that had fled to a shadow called the shell.Speaking in tongues I hadn’t heard of, with wild patterns I knew not well enough by heart, but gracefully enough by the rapid keystrokes of my fingers. And I tinkered with the idea that something more could come from c. Something sharper, something that hit the high notes of a piano and sparked a ruby shade of red. Something that struck the morning air like the strong richness of coffee beans roasting. Something that would prove that coding truly is an art in and of itself, Not because it integrates elements from other areas of life that just happen to repeat themselves so often enough it eventually becomes too obvious not to quantify. Because I have grown weary of being hindered by science and the structures of data. Yes, it is proven to exist, but it cannot explain the leaps I feel when I am called and pulled in all directions. Except when it chooses to. I am not sick of science. I am sick of those who chose to impose their science upon me. False science. Too small science. Doesn’t fit the right model science. And here I am staring the fact in the face, it isn’t coding or science or anything else. It was the promise I almost broke to younger self that no matter how hard life tried to pry wry fingers in between the plans I had made for myself that I would not give in The death of an artist starts not with the choice to speak in a language does not build for their tongue but with the refusal to make it their own. Get creative.It’s all you have left.";
